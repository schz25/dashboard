<h1> Dashboard Project </h1>
<h3> This project was built with flexbox and grid as well as being fully responsive
  in tablet or mobile view.</h3>
  <ul><h4> These are some of the aspects I plan on improving to this project: <h4>
  <li>Changing the dashboard logo to match the rest of the sidebar text color.</li>
  <li>Adding more grid items to make the grid have 6 items total and 2 items to the right of the grid.</li>
  <li>Improving the styling on the grid items by adding more icons to the bottom of each icon.</li>
  </ul>

 <h3>This project taught me the fundamentals of using grid and combining that with flexbox to make the
   ultimate responsive design that is ready to use on most screen sizes. This has been my first project with
   grid and I plan on doing more research and improving my skills with these layouts to come back and 
   implement the changes stated above.</h3>
